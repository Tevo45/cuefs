• unsure if seeking on a file works correctly
• current treatment of lossy sources is less than ideal
• everything will get resampled to 44100Hz/16bit/2channel
• the codebase is a mess
• reading concurrently from the same fid might break decoding logic, or be unecessarily slow (does that ever happen?)
• the parser might be leaking memory (it strdup()s the strings before passing to yacc, but we strdup() some of them again when setting the sheet fields)
• zuke with wav keeps requesting the file header at offsets 0, 4 and 8; never starts playing
• some parser/cuefs behavior might be non-standard or undesirable
	- for example, there's currently no way to split tracks without including the pregap either at the end of the last track or beggining of current one
• parser is incomplete
• splitting tracks from → to the same format could some times be done more efficiently, skipping the decode (and resample) → encode process; this could be especially beneficial to lossy formats since there would be no reencoding.
• some cuesheets have metadata (that would otherwise have nowhere to be in the sheet) stored in comments, in a somewhat semistandard manner, i.e.
		REM GENRE "Progressive Rock"
		REM DATE 2002
	it probably wouldn't hurt to try parsing some of those; not a high priority at the moment
• cuefs does not respect PREGAP and POSTGAP tags on cuesheets
