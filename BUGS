• unsure if seeking on a file works correctly
• current treatment of lossy sources is less than ideal
• can only serve .wav and raw pcm files (no flac encoder)
• everything will get resampled to 44100kHz/16bit/2channel
• the codebase is a mess
• reading concurrently from the same fid might break decoding logic, or be unecessarily slow (does that ever happen?)
