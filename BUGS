• unsure if seeking on a file works correctly
• current treatment of lossy sources is less than ideal
• everything will get resampled to 44100Hz/16bit/2channel
• the codebase is a mess
• reading concurrently from the same fid might break decoding logic, or be unecessarily slow (does that ever happen?)
• zuke causes wavserve to do a negative readdec() somehow
• some parser/cuefs behavior might be non-standard or undesirable
	- for example, there's currently no way to split tracks without including the pregap either at the end of the last track or beggining of current one
• parser is incomplete
